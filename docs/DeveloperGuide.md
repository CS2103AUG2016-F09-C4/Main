## Setting up

#### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
    
2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace


#### Importing the project into Eclipse

0. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
1. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given 
   in the prerequisites above)
2. Click `File` > `Import`
3. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
4. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
5. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process)

## Problem Domain

With the use of Activity Diagrams, we can understand the context under which `Dowat` is used.
Users of `Dowat` receive their task and event items mainly from their email inbox.
By storing the task or event received immediately into `Dowat`, the user can archive the email immediately.
By accessing `Dowat`, the user is able to determine the important tasks at hand and upcoming events for the day or week.
This will help the user plan their use of time more effectively.

## Design

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>
The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/task/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invoke clean up method where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play an important role at the architecture level.
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used to by componnents to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log files.

The rest of the App consists four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : The UI of tha App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components
* Defines its _API_ an interface with the same name as the Component. `Logic.java`
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class e.g. `LogicManager.java`

<!-- @@author A0127570H -->
The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete /t 1`.

<img src="images/SDforDeleteTask.png" width="800">

>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `ModelChangedEvent` when the model is changed,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br>

<img src="images/SDforDeleteTaskEventHandling.png" width="800">

> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct 
  coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/task/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `EventListPanel`, `CalendarView`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow` inherits from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/task/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raises from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

### Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/task/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`
5. The UndoableCommandHistory applies the Singleton pattern which holds the sole copy of the modifications done to the `Dowat`. 
6. We did not choose to store a list of events/tasks, or copies of `Dowat` as a history. Instead, we chose to store a stack of commands which are more lightweighted, and occupy less storage.

### Model component

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/task/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences
* Stores the dowat data
* Exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` as well as `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyEvent>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/task/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save dowat data in xml format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.taskbook.commans` package. 

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging.Logger` as our logger, and `LogsCenter` is used to manage the logging levels 
of loggers and handlers (for output of log messages)

- The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file 
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
- The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to 
  the specified logging level

- Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and `.log`

**Logging Levels**

- SEVERE
  - Critical use case affected, which may possibly cause the termination of the application

- WARNING
  - Can continue, but with caution

- INFO
  - Information important for the application's purpose
    - e.g. update to local model/request sent to cloud
  - Information that the layman user can understand

- FINE
  - Used for superficial debugging purposes to pinpoint components that the fault/bug is likely to arise from
  - Should include more detailed information as compared to `INFO` i.e. log useful information!
    - e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file 
(default: `config.json`):


<!-- @@author A0144702N -->
## Managing Dependencies
We use several external dependencies:

1. [Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing.
2. [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava)
3. [Controlsfx](http://fxexperience.com/controlsfx/) for javafx controls.
4. [testfx](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) for javafx testing. 
5. [prettytime](https://github.com/ocpsoft/prettytime/tree/master/nlp) for natural language processing of time and date. 
6. [jfxtras](http://jfxtras.org) for calendar view controls. 
The dependencies are bound into the jar release and will not require extra dependencies handling for end users.

## Appendix F : Pull Request

None of the parts below are compulsory for a PR, but a good template to follow in general. Developers are free to add in or remove sections as stated below. 

### Context
Here you should write the context/background of the code changes, a good format to follow is.

* What's the problem/feature
* How what you are doing solves/adds that problem/feature
* Anything you feel will help to understand your changes

### Links
Here you should add links that are related to this Pull Request. For example:

* Issue Links
* Commit Links
* Documentation Links

### Media
Normally, if you are working on a feature that has a UI component, you
should add a gif or a video of the behaviour. If the behaviour is not
that complex and you feel like an image will do the trick, then it's
fine. For gifs/videos we use [recordit.co](http://recordit.co)/

If it's a feature without UI, you can ignore this part.

### Reviewers
Here you tag all the persons you feel should review the ticket (your project teammates for example)
