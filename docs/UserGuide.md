   <img src="images/Add.png" width="500">
   * **`mark 1`**: after you are done with a task, simply mark it off from the list. Tasks will be sorted so you can easily find those tasks with closer deadlines at the top of the list!
   * **`list /t /a`** : you can also lists all tasks that are completed, and shown as below.  
   <img src="images/List_Done.png" width="500">

#### Traversing between Windows
The four main windows in which the user can traverse are:

  * Command Box
  * Result Display Panel
  * Task Panel
  * Event Panel

By utilizing the TAB key, the user is able to switch between the different windows in the above-mentioned order. 
The order of traversal is descending down the list before it loops back to the beginning. 

The window in which the user is currently on is shown by a brown border highlight as shown in the figure below.

#### Command Box Features
When the Command Box is selected, it has 2 main features:

* Clearing the Command Box

  Pressing the DELETE key will clear the Command Box of its text content. This allows for easy clearing of commands.

* Accessing past History of Commands
  
  Pressing the UP key will access the previous command in the history and will copy it into the Command Box. 
  Pressing the DOWN key will access the next command in the history and will copy it into the Command Box. 

  The Command history resets itself after each session of usage (i.e exit the program).
  A Command is only added into the Command history when it is executed by the Command Box (i.e ENTER key press).

#### Result Display Panel Features
When the Result Display Panel is selected, it has a scrolling feature where the UP and DOWN key would be able to control the scroll bar within the window. 
This prevents the need to use the mouse wheel for scrolling.

#### Task and Event Panel Features
