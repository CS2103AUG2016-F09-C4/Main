- Should come with automated unit tests and open source code.
- Should favor DOS style commands over Unix-style commands.
- Should work only with Command Line Interface as the main input with minimal use of mouse/clicking. GUI only serves as the source of output of results. 
- Should be a result of morphing the given sample code. i.e. enhance and/or evolve the given code to arrive at the new software. 
- Should work on a desktop without network/Internet connection. It should not be a mobile app or a cloud-based application. 
- Should work stand-alone. It should not be a plug-in to another software. 
- Should follow the Object-oriented paradigm. 
- Should work without requiring an installer. Having an optional installer is OK as longs as the portable (non-installed) version has all the critical functionality. 
- Should only work with Third Party User/Libraries if they are free.
- do not require any installation by the user of your software.
- do not violate other constraints.

#### Traversing between Windows
The four main windows in which you can traverse are:

  * Command Box
  * Result Display Panel
  * Task Panel
  * Event Panel

By utilizing the TAB key, you are able to switch between the different windows in the above-mentioned order. 
The order of traversal is descending down the list before it loops back to the beginning. 

The window in which you are currently on is shown by a brown border highlight. 
An example of window traversal is shown in the figure below.

#### Command Box Features
When the Command Box is selected, it has 2 main features:

* Clearing the Command Box

  Pressing the DELETE key will clear the Command Box of its text content. This allows for easy clearing of commands.
  	<img src="images/CommandBoxDelete.gif" width="700">

* Accessing past History of Commands
  
  Pressing the UP key will access the previous command in the history and will copy it into the Command Box. 
  Pressing the DOWN key will access the next command in the history and will copy it into the Command Box. 

  The Command history resets itself after each session of usage (i.e exit the program).
  A Command is only added into the Command history when it is executed by the Command Box (i.e ENTER key press).
  <img src="images/CommandBoxHistory.gif" width="700">

#### Result Display Panel Features
When the Result Display Panel is selected, it has a scrolling feature where the UP and DOWN key would be able to control the scroll bar within the window. 
This prevents the need to use the mouse wheel for scrolling.
	<img src="images/ResultDisplayScroll.gif" width="700">

#### Task and Event Panel Features
When the Task or Event Panel is selected, it has a scrolling feature where the UP and DOWN key would be able to control the scroll bar within the window. 
This prevents the need to use the mouse wheel for scrolling.

#### Marking a task as completed
Mark an existing task as completed in Dowat.

Format: `mark INDEX`

> Marks the task at the specified `INDEX` to change its completion status. The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing of tasks.
> Marking an uncompleted task will change its status to completed while marking a completed task will change its status to uncompleted.
> Completed tasks will not be shown in the list of tasks in Dowat.
> Uncompleted tasks can be shown when listing all tasks.
> Marked tasks in the current session can be reverted with the `undo` command.
> An event cannot be marked completed.

Examples: 
* `mark 1`  
  Marks the 1st task in the last shown listing as completed.
  <img src="images/MarkTask.gif" width="700">

#### Deleting a task/event
Deletes an existing task/event from Dowat storage completely.  

Format: `delete /t|/e INDEX`

> Deletes the task/event at the specified `INDEX` in the most recent task/event listing.
> Deleted tasks or events will not be shown even with `list /t|/e /a` command. 
> Deleted tasks or events in the current session can be recovered with the `undo` command.

Examples:
* `delete /e 2`  
  Deletes the 2nd event in the most recent event listing.

Examples: 
* `clear /t` <br>
