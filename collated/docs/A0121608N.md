## Appendix C : Non Functional Requirements
- Storage
  - Should not use relational databases. Data storage must be done using text, json, xml files you create yourself. 
  - Should be stored locally and should be in a human editable text file. The intention of this constraint is to allow advanced users to manipulate the data by editing the data file.

- GUI
  - Text should be font size 12.
  - Text should be Times New Romans.

- Should work on the Windows 7 or later.
- Should work on any mainstream OS as long as it has Java 8 or higher installed.
- Should be able to hold up to 1000 tasks.
- Should come with automated unit tests and open source code.
- Should favor DOS style commands over Unix-style commands.
- Should work only with Command Line Interface as the main input with minimal use of mouse/clicking. GUI only serves as the source of output of results. 
- Should be a result of morphing the given sample code. i.e. enhance and/or evolve the given code to arrive at the new software. 
- Should work on a desktop without network/Internet connection. It should not be a mobile app or a cloud-based application. 
- Should work stand-alone. It should not be a plug-in to another software. 
- Should follow the Object-oriented paradigm. 
- Should work without requiring an installer. Having an optional installer is OK as longs as the portable (non-installed) version has all the critical functionality. 
- Should only work with Third Party User/Libraries if they are free.
- do not require any installation by the user of your software.
- do not violate other constraints.

## UI Control

#### Traversing between Windows
The four main windows in which the user can traverse are:

	* Command Box
	* Result Display Panel
	* Task Panel
	* Event Panel

By utilizing the TAB key, the user is able to switch between the different windows in the above-mentioned order. The order of traversal is descending down the list before it loops back to the beginning. 

The window in which the user is currently on is shown by a brown border highlight.

#### Command Box Features
When the Command Box is selected, it has 2 main features:

* Clearing the Command Box

	Pressing the DELETE key will clear the Command Box of its text content. This allows for easy clearing of commands.

* Accessing past History of Commands
	
	Pressing the UP key will access the previous command in the history and will copy it into the Command Box. Pressing the DOWN key will access the next command in the history and will copy it into the Command Box. 

	The Command history resets itself after each session of usage (i.e exit the program).

#### Result Display Panel Features
When the Result Display Panel is selected, it has a scrolling feature where the UP and DOWN key would be able to control the scroll bar within the window. This prevents the need to use the mouse wheel for scrolling.

#### Task and Event Panel Features
When the Task or Event Panel is selected, it has a scrolling feature where the UP and DOWN key would be able to control the scroll bar within the window. This prevents the need to use the mouse wheel for scrolling.
