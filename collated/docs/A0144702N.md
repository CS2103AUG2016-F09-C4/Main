### Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/task/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`
5. The UndoableCommandHistory applies the Singleton pattern which holds the sole copy of the modifications done to the `Dowat`. 
6. We did not choose to store a list of events/tasks, or copies of `Dowat` as a history. Instead, we chose to store a stack of commands which are more lightweighted, and occupy less storage.

## Managing Dependencies
We use several external dependencies:

1. [Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing.
2. [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava)
3. [Controlsfx](http://fxexperience.com/controlsfx/) for javafx controls.
4. [testfx](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) for javafx testing. 
5. [prettytime](https://github.com/ocpsoft/prettytime/tree/master/nlp) for natural language processing of time and date. 
6. [jfxtras](http://jfxtras.org) for calendar view controls. 
The dependencies are bound into the jar release and will not require extra dependencies handling for end users.

#### Use case 3: List tasks/events

**MSS**

1. User requests to list tasks/events
2. `Dowat` shows a list of tasks/events
Use case ends.

The Use case can be elaborated by the SD as below in addition the SD mentioned in the [Design](#design):  

<img src="images/ListOverall.png" width="800"><br>
<img src="images/ListRefSD.png" width="800"><br>

The SD for list events is similiar to task.

#### Use case 11: Simple find for tasks  

**MSS**<br>
1. User request to find for tasks containing a set of keywords in description<br>
2. `Dowat` displays zero or more tasks matching the find criteria<br>

  Use case ends.

**Extensions**<br>
1a. No keywords entered after command word
  > 1a1. `Dowat` displays help message on the find command
  Use case resumes at step 1

#### Use case 12: Undo modification

**MSS**<br>
1. User requests to undo the last modification.<br>
2. `Dowat` shows the last command which modified the `Dowat` database<br>
3. `Dowat` undoes the the last modification<br>

  Use case ends.

**Extensions**<br>
1a. There is no command which modified the `Dowat` during this session
  > 1a1. `Dowat` displays displays a message indicating no commands can be undone
  Use case ends

Besides the abstract SD as shown in the section [Design](#design).<br>
A more detailed Sequence Diagram of undo a deletion of task is shown below.

<img src="images/UndoRefSD.png" width="800"><br>

#### Use case 13: Show calendar views

**MSS**<br>
1. User requests to show a certain time period with a certain view.<br>
2. Calendar view is updated in the `Dowat`.<br>
  
  Use Case ends


**Extensions**<br>
1a. User key in invalid time or date. 
  > 1a1. `Dowat` feedbacks time is not valid.

  Use Case ends

Notice how this command does not involve the Model Component at all.<br>
Since it does not need to retrieve or modidfy data in the model.

## Appendix F : Pull Request

None of the parts below are compulsory for a PR, but a good template to follow in general. Developers are free to add in or remove sections as stated below. 

### Context
Here you should write the context/background of the code changes, a good format to follow is.

* What's the problem/feature
* How what you are doing solves/adds that problem/feature
* Anything you feel will help to understand your changes

### Links
Here you should add links that are related to this Pull Request. For example:

* Issue Links
* Commit Links
* Documentation Links

### Media
Normally, if you are working on a feature that has a UI component, you
should add a gif or a video of the behaviour. If the behaviour is not
that complex and you feel like an image will do the trick, then it's
fine. For gifs/videos we use [recordit.co](http://recordit.co)/

If it's a feature without UI, you can ignore this part.

### Reviewers
Here you tag all the persons you feel should review the ticket (your project teammates for example)
