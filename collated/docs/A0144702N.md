### Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/task/logic/Logic.java)

The `Logic` component,
* Uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
* Results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
* Command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
* Result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.
* `UndoableCommandHistory` applies the Singleton pattern which holds the sole copy of the modifications done to the `Dowat`. 
* `UndoableCommandHistory` does not store a list of events/tasks, or copies of `Dowat` as a history. Instead, it stores a stack of commands which are more lightweighted, and occupy less storage.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.taskbook.commons` package.
Some examples of common classes include:
  - CalendarView: enum describes the calendar view.
  - Status: enum describes the filtered status of tasks and events. 
  - Messages: standardized messages used throughout the app. 

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging.Logger` as our logger, and `LogsCenter` is used to manage the logging levels 
of loggers and handlers (for output of log messages)

- The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file 
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
- The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to 
  the specified logging level

- Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and `.log`

**Logging Levels**

- SEVERE
  - Critical use case affected, which may possibly cause the termination of the application  
  eg: Fatal error during initializing,  
  eg: Unsync Calendar during execution. 

- WARNING:
  - Critical use case happen, but can recover and continue execution:
    eg:Can't find stage Test App, Therefore, aborting focusin  

- INFO
  - Information important for the application's purpose
    - Setting up and init. 
      eg:  `Setting up Calendar panel...`  
    - User command:
      `----------------[USER COMMAND][<Command>]`  
      eg: `----------------[USER COMMAND][mark 1]`  
    - System command (for undo):
      `-----------[SYSTEM UNDO COMMAND][<Command>]`  
      eg: `-----------[SYSTEM UNDO COMMAND][mark 1]`  
    - Posting an event:
      `-----[Event Posted][<Event Information>]`  
      eg: `------[Event Posted] seedu.task.commons.events.model.TaskBookChangedEvent: [number of tasks 10] [number of events 9]`  
    - Reveiving an event:
      `--[Event Handled] [<Response Message>]`  
      eg: `--[Event handled][[number of tasks 10] [number of events 9]Local data changed, saving to file]`

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file 
(default: `config.json`):



## Managing Dependencies
We use several external dependencies:

1. [Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing.
2. [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava)
3. [Controlsfx](http://fxexperience.com/controlsfx/) for javafx controls.
4. [testfx](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) for javafx testing. 
5. [prettytime](https://github.com/ocpsoft/prettytime/tree/master/nlp) for natural language processing of time and date. 
6. [jfxtras](http://jfxtras.org) for calendar view controls. 
The dependencies are bound into the jar release and will not require extra dependencies handling for end users.

#### Use case 10: Undo modification

**MSS**<br>
1. User requests to undo the last modification.<br>
2. `Dowat` shows the last command which modified the `Dowat` database<br>
3. `Dowat` undoes the the last modification<br>

  Use case ends.

**Extensions**<br>
1a. There is no command which modified the `Dowat` during this session
  > 1a1. `Dowat` displays displays a message indicating no commands can be undone
  Use case ends

Besides the abstract SD as shown in the section [Design](#design).<br>
A more detailed Sequence Diagram of undo a deletion of task is shown below.

<img src="images/UndoRefSD.png" width="600"><br>

#### Use case 11: Show calendar views

**MSS**<br>
1. User requests to show a certain time period with a certain view.<br>
2. Calendar view is updated in the `Dowat`.<br>
  
  Use Case ends


**Extensions**<br>
1a. User key in invalid time or date. 
  > 1a1. `Dowat` feedbacks time is not valid.

  Use Case ends

Notice how this command does not involve the Model Component at all.<br>
Since it does not need to retrieve or modidfy data in the model.

   <img src="images/Add.png" width="500">
   * **`mark 1`**: after you are done with a task, simply mark it off from the list. Tasks will be sorted so you can easily find those tasks with closer deadlines at the top of the list!
   * **`list /t /a`** : you can also lists all tasks that are completed, and shown as below.  
   <img src="images/List_Done.png" width="500">
   * **`undo`**: if you accidently do anything wrong, you can undo the modifications also!
   * **`edit /t 1 /by one hour later`** Edit any field you need (description, name, deadline, event duration ...) with the edit command. Where the index `1` refers to the index of the task / event in the respective list.   
   :wink: Check out the [Features](#features) for a complete set of commands you can use!
