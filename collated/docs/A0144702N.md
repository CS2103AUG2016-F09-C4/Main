### Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`
5. The UndoableCommandHistory applies the Singleton pattern which holds the sole copy of the modifications done to the Taskbook. 
6. We did not choose to store a list of events/tasks, or copies of taskbooks as a history. Instead, we chose to store a stack of commands which are more lightweighted, and occupy less storage.

## Managing Dependencies
We use several external dependencies:
1. [Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing.
2. [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava)
3. [Controlsfx](http://fxexperience.com/controlsfx/) for javafx controls.
4. [testfx](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) for javafx testing. 
5. [prettytime](https://github.com/ocpsoft/prettytime/tree/master/nlp) for natural language processing of time and date. 
6. [jfxtras](http://jfxtras.org) for calendar view controls. 
The dependencies are bound into the jar release and will not require extra dependencies handling for end users.

The SD for list events is similiar to task.

#### Use case 10: Simple find for tasks  

**MSS**
1. User request to find for tasks containing a set of keywords in description
2. TaskBook displays zero or more tasks matching the find criteria

  Use case ends.

**Extensions**
1a. No keywords entered after command word
  > 1a1. Taskbook displays help message on the find command
  Use case resumes at step 1

#### Use case 11: Undo modification

**MSS**
1. User requests to undo the last modification. 
2. TaskBook shows the last command which modified the TaskBook database
3. TaskBook undoes the the last modification

  Use case ends.

**Extensions**
Extensions
1a. There is no command which modified the TaskBook during this session
  > 1a1. Taskbook displays displays a message indicating no commands can be undone
  Use case ends

Besides the abstract SD as shown in the section [Design](#design). A more detailed Sequence Diagram of undo a deletion of task is shown below.

#### Use case 12: Show calendar views

**MSS**
1. User requests to show a certain time period with a certain view.
2. Calendar view is updated in the TaskBook. 
  
  Use Case ends


**Extensions**
1a. User key in invalid time or date. 
  > 1a1. Taskbook feedbacks time is not valid.

  Use Case ends

Notice how this command does not involve the Model Component at all. Since it does not need to retrieve or modidfy data in the model.

## Appendix F : Pull Request

None of the parts below are compulsory for a PR, but a good template to follow in general. Developers are free to add in or remove sections as stated below. 

### Context
Here you should write the context/background of the code changes, a good format to follow is.

* What's the problem/feature
* How what you are doing solves/adds that problem/feature
* Anything you feel will help to understand your changes

### Links
Here you should add links that are related to this Pull Request. For example:

* Issue Links
* Commit Links
* Documentation Links

### Media
Normally, if you are working on a feature that has a UI component, you
should add a gif or a video of the behaviour. If the behaviour is not
that complex and you feel like an image will do the trick, then it's
fine. For gifs/videos we use [recordit.co](http://recordit.co)/

If it's a feature without UI, you can ignore this part.

### Reviewers
Here you tag all the persons you feel should review the ticket (your project teammates for example)

```
