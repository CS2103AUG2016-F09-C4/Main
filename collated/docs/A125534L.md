## Appendix C : Non Functional Requirements
- Storage
  - Should not use relational databases. Data storage must be done using text, json, xml files you create yourself. 
  - Should be stored locally and should be in a human editable text file. The intention of this constraint is to allow advanced users to manipulate the data by editing the data file.

- GUI
  - Text should be font size 12.
  - Text should be Times New Romans.

- Should work on the Windows 7 or later.
- Should work on any mainstream OS as long as it has Java 8 or higher installed.
- Should be able to hold up to 1000 tasks.
- Should come with automated unit tests and open source code.
- Should favor DOS style commands over Unix-style commands.
- Should work only with Command Line Interface as the main input with minimal use of mouse/clicking. GUI only serves as the source of output of results. 
- Should be a result of morphing the given sample code. i.e. enhance and/or evolve the given code to arrive at the new software. 
- Should work on a desktop without network/Internet connection. It should not be a mobile app or a cloud-based application. 
- Should work stand-alone. It should not be a plug-in to another software. 
- Should follow the Object-oriented paradigm. 
- Should work without requiring an installer. Having an optional installer is OK as longs as the portable (non-installed) version has all the critical functionality. 
- Should only work with Third Party User/Libraries if they are free.
- do not require any installation by the user of your software.
- do not violate other constraints.
