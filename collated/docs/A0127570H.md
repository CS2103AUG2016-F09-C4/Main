The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete /t 1`.

<img src="images/SDforDeleteTask.png" width="800">

>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `ModelChangedEvent` when the model is changed,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br>

<img src="images/SDforDeleteTaskEventHandling.png" width="800">

> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct 
  coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/task/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `EventListPanel`, `CalendarView`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow` inherits from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/task/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raises from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

### Model component

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/task/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences
* Stores the `Dowat` data
* Exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` as well as `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyEvent>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/task/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* Saves `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* Saves `Dowat` data in xml format and read it back.

#### Use case 1: Add task/event

**MSS**

1. User requests to add task/event of specified parameters
2. `Dowat` adds task/event to system
Use case ends.

The use case of adding a task is elaborated by the SD as follows.

<img src="images/addtask.png" width="700"><br>
<img src="images/addtaskSD.png" width="700"><br>

The SD for adding a task is similar to adding an event.

**Extensions**

1a. The add task/event request has invalid format
  > 1a1. `Dowat` displays an error message
  Use case resumes at step 1

<br>
```
###### /DeveloperGuide.md
``` md

#### Use case 3: Edit task/event details

**MSS**<br>
1. User requests to list tasks/events<br>
2. `Dowat` displays a list of tasks/events<br>
3. User requests to edit task/event in the list with new specified parameters with the index of task/event in the list<br>
4. `Dowat` edits existing task/event in database according to new specified parameters<br>
  Use case ends.

The use case of editing an event is elaborated by the SD as follows.

<img src="images/editevent.png" width="700"><br>
<img src="images/editeventSD.png" width="700"><br>

The SD for editing an event is similar to editing a task.

**Extensions**<br>
3a. The given index is invalid
  > 3a1. `Dowat` displays an error message that task/event cannot be found
  Use case resumes at step 2

Format: `add TASK_NAME [/desc DESCRIPTION] [/by DEADLINE_DATETIME]` <br>
 
> Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters, parameters will follow behind their corresponding keyword. 
> With the exception of `TASK_NAME`, all other parameters are optional. The order of parameters are not fixed. 
> `DEADLINE_DATETIME` can be entered in any natural language format.
> For date, entering words like today, tomorrow and day after are recognised.
> Dates entered in numeric form must be in the format of MM-DD-YYYY.
> Only valid dates are recognised correctly.
> For time, entering 7pm, 1900 or 19.00 are recognised.

#### Adding an event
Similar to adding a task, you can also add an event to Dowat<br>

Format: `add EVENT_NAME /from START_DATETIME [/to END_DATETIME] [/desc DESCRIPTION]` <br>
